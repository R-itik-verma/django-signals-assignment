# Django Signals and Rectangle Class Assignment

This repository contains solutions to the Django Signals and Custom Python Class assignment.

## Structure

### Django Signals
1. **Question 1:** Demonstrates whether Django signals are executed synchronously or asynchronously.
2. **Question 2:** Validates whether Django signals run in the same thread as the caller.
3. **Question 3:** Explores whether Django signals operate in the same database transaction as the caller.

- Accepts `length` and `width` during initialization.
- Supports iteration to output `{'length': value}` and `{'width': value}`.
